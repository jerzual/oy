The server logic is managed here

some things to note:

the server holds :

- The world seed and connections to clients
  - only the seed of levels generated by clients
- A 'light' version of the clients state (position + velocity).
- The state of dynamic entities (doors, treasures, trap, items) per level.
  - should be reset after a time

It is responsible for:

- dispatching events from players
- managing monsters ai ? (not there yet)

the server IS NOT responsible for

- managing collisions
- managing sound / input data.
